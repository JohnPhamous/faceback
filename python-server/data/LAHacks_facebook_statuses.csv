Earlier this month at our most recent hackathon, a team accidentally made it on stage as a part of our Top 7 Hacks that should not have been up there. Wingman was a hack that is not consistent with the LA Hacks brand, and the views of their creators conflict directly with our views for the hacker community.

LA Hacks does not tolerate sexism of any kind, and we will ensure that such errors will not be made in future events. It's a shame to see that teams think it's okay to make something like Wingman, and we sincerely apologize for the oversight in letting them even be a part of the expo. With over 250 teams presenting, ensuring that no offensive hacks even get to be a part of the expo is something we will fix in future LA Hacks events.

A different hack called Mixr, developed by Luke Sorenson, John Moore, and Timothy Chong from Boston University, was actually voted into the top 7 by our judges. During the collection phase there was unfortunately an error in reporting. Wingman was near Mixr in the expo, both were  Tinder-inspired hacks, and both groups used the term ""wingman"" in their demos throughout the expos. Wingman ended up being written down as a top 7 candidate rather than Mixr, which was actually the intended hack to place in our top 7.

433391036751817_593894254034827,"We are proud to announce Quixey, The Search Engine for Apps, as the Partner Sponsor for LAHacks!!!

Quixey provides a semantic app search engine that has raised some $74.2 million from the likes of Alibaba, Eric Schmidt's Innovation Endeavors and others. They are one of the biggest players in the mobile space today and have recently shocked the tech scene by announcing a new direction for the company.

Check out some of the articles written about Quixey in the past couple days:

""Right now, it may take up to eight taps to get to the exact kind of table you want in a game like Zynga Poker. But with Quixey's search solution that can glean data from inside an app, you'd be able to search for an open table of Texas Hold'Em Poker, join it, and even get results from other poker apps you may not have known about."" -- Wired

""It's the next step in Quixey's quest to shake up the mobile search business.""-- CNET

""Today, mobile users search through  app stores, browsers and other means to get information on the fly. Increasingly much of the information they want is wrapped up in apps with key details, like delivery time, price and location for a service, living several links deeper into the app. Mr. Kagan wants to change that."" -- Wall Street Journal

""Quixey's search engine wants to become the platform for content consumption in itself, the link between a user needing information and then finding the app that will give it to them. Quixey calls this concept ""search as a platform"", and it's so committed to the concept that Kagan tells me Quixey's filed for a trademark on the phrase."" -- TechCrunch

""In an interview last year, CEO Tomer Kagan said that the company's goal was to develop the ability to search for information within apps. At Mobile World Congress, Quixey is discussing how it plans to do that, essentially by allowing app makers to specify the type of information they are capable of serving up and then making the information available to Quixey's engine."" -- Re/code

""There will be certain boundaries for how much info apps can show in Functional Search, but it is up to developers to decide which format to display information about their apps. ""Those that are willing to go on a limb and show more of their data and expose themselves will probably win over the hearts and minds,"" Kagan added."" -- FierceWireless
