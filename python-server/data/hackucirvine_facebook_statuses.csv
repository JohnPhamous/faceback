- There are three states of being. Not knowing, action and completion.

- Accept that everything is a draft. It helps to get it done.
There is no editing stage.

- Pretending you know what you're doing is almost the same as knowing what you are doing, so just accept that you know what you're doing even if you don't and do it.

- Banish procrastination. If you wait more than a week to get an idea done, abandon it.

- The point of being done is not to finish but to get other things done.

- Once you're done you can throw it away.

- Laugh at perfection. It's boring and keeps you from being done.

- People without dirty hands are wrong. Doing something makes you right.

- Failure counts as done. So do mistakes.

- Destruction is a variant of done.

- If you have an idea and publish it on the internet, that counts as a ghost of done.

- Done is the engine of more.

""Through movies like The Social Network and The Internship, mainstream media has created a misleading image of the individuals who make up the tech industry--a bunch of hoodie-clad guys, typing obsessively at their laptops at 3 a.m., fueled by caffeine and junk food. Even this past week, the trailer for HBO's new comedy TV series ""Silicon Valley"" featured no women, and a plethora of stereotypical male programmers.

At she++, we're trying to change that. We want to introduce you to the women in technology--the software engineers, designers, and program managers--hacking cool things all across the tech spectrum. There are countless women making an impact on the world through their contributions to technology. And regardless of whether you're not sure if CS is for you, you're one of few women in your CS classes, or you're joining a company as their first female engineering hire, many of these women have been in the same position. With this in mind, the she++ Video Library team has set out to interview these women and feature their inspirational words of wisdom as part of the she++ Video Library, which launched today.""",she++ Video Library Teaser,video,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzsKbNa051I,2014-04-17 13:30:00,6,0,0,6,0,0,0,0,0,3.0,0.0,"['check', 'video', 'friends', 'sheplusplus', 'https', 'through', 'movies', 'like', 'social', 'network', 'internship', 'mainstream', 'media', 'created', 'misleading', 'image', 'individuals', 'make', 'tech', 'industry', 'bunch', 'guys', 'typing', 'laptops', 'fueled', 'caffeine', 'junk', 'food', 'past', 'week', 'trailer', 'hbo', 'new', 'comedy', 'series', 'silicon', 'valley', 'featured', 'women', 'plethora', 'stereotypical', 'male', 'programmers', 'trying', 'change', 'want', 'introduce', 'women', 'technology', 'software', 'engineers', 'designers', 'program', 'managers', 'hacking', 'cool', 'things', 'across', 'tech', 'spectrum', 'there', 'countless', 'women', 'making', 'impact', 'world', 'contributions', 'technology', 'and', 'regardless', 'whether', 'sure', 'women', 'classes', 'joining', 'company', 'female', 'engineering', 'hire', 'many', 'women', 'position', 'with', 'mind', 'video', 'library', 'team', 'set', 'interview', 'women', 'feature', 'inspirational', 'words', 'wisdom', 'part', 'video', 'library', 'launched', 'today']",4,3,92
